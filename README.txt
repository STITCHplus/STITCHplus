Here are some of the deliverables for the STITCHplus project.
The project involves using linkeddata to enhance research capablities.

It contains modules to make matches from one thesauri to another (VIAF // DBpedia).
Also it contains an OAI harvester to fetch metadata from the kb thesauri.

The modules are mostly coded in Python and Ruby.
